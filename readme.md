# Physics Mini Project

This repository contains the source code for the "Physics" mini project, which is part of the [Godot 4 Mini Projects course](https://academy.zenva.com/course/godot-4-mini-projects/) offered by Zenva Academy.

## Project Overview

The "Physics" mini project is designed to introduce and explore the physics engine within Godot 4. Through this project, learners will gain hands-on experience with Godot's physics components, including rigid bodies, collision shapes, and physics processes. The project aims to provide a practical understanding of how to implement realistic physics behaviors in game objects.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone this repository to your local machine. Ensure you have Godot 4 installed on your system. Open the project in Godot, and you can run the project directly from the Godot editor.
